310	Meg wanted to bake a pie. She asked her mother for help.$$They measured the flour, sugar, and butter for the crust. $Her mother showed her how to roll out the crust. Meg sliced $the apples and put them in the pie pan. They put the pie $in the hot oven and waited 45 minutes.$$As the pie baked, a delicious smell filled the kitchen. When $the timer rang, they took the pie out of the oven and $set it on the window sill to cool.#1#1.35#1#0.535
320	Zack sat down in his chair. It was time for class. The $teacher asked for last night's homework. Zack opened his $backpack to take out his homework folder. His homework $folder wasn't in it. His recorder was gone too. $$In the backpack there was a science book and a math $book. They were both too hard for Zack. There was a $piece of homework inside a green folder. The name on $it said 'Jason'. Zack must have taken his brother's identical $backpack while hurrying out the door this morning.#1#1.35#1#0.535
330	Sam and Jo went for a hike. They took a path through the $woods. Suddenly, Sam heard a noise coming from the tree $above their heads. Jo climbed up to see what the noise was $and found two baby squirrels. The babies were alone, but $their mother must be somewhere near. The children watched $and waited.$$Sure enough, the mother soon returned with a mouthful of nuts. $The noises stopped as the baby squirrels began to eat.$$Sam and Jo smiled, knowing the squirrels were safe with $their mother.#1#1.35#1#0.535
350	Do you see a face on the moon? Lots of people $see something. The man on the moon is what we $see in America. In Japan, people see a rabbit on $the moon. People in other cultures see a goddess, $or a boy picking up sticks.$$The shapes on the moon are made out of $shadows. The moon is covered in rocks. The $shadows made by those moon rocks can look like $a face, or a rabbit, or a boy.#1#1.35#1#0.535
410	Emma loves Saturday mornings. Her parents go to $work. So Emma spends time with Ms. Brown who $lives next door.$$Ms. Brown always has a jigsaw puzzle on her table. $Emma loves working on the puzzles with her.$$When Emma was little, Ms. Brown had small puzzles $with big pieces. But now that Emma is in sixth $grade, they work together on large puzzles with $hundreds of very small pieces.#1#1.35#1#0.535
420	An hour ago the sun was bright. The sky had been its $familiar blue. But now it is nearly dark at three PM. $A solar eclipse is causing this unusual event.$$The moon is passing between the earth and sun, blocking $most of the sunlight for about eight minutes. Only a small $part of the earth will see this solar eclipse.$$Long ago people were afraid of eclipses. They thought the $world was ending. Now we know the moon will continue $on its path and sunlight will return shortly.#1#1.35#1#0.535
450	Rules are strict at Peter's house. Each day, Peter gets just $one hour of screen time. It could be on a computer or on $TV. $$Kayla's parents say that she can watch television as much $as she wants, as long as she finishes her homework. $$Why can't all parents be on the same page? Both Peter $and Kayla are doing well with school work and they follow $the same rules at school. Because of the rules at Peter's $house, he plays outside more often than Kayla does.#1#1.35#1#0.535
520	On warm summer nights, Dan and Mark sleep outside $in sleeping bags. They like to look up at all the $stars and planets in the night sky.$$Mark can now easily locate the Big Dipper and the $Little Dipper. If they are really lucky, they can see $shooting stars streak across the sky.$$Sometimes there are slower moving lights in the $sky. These aren't stars, but they may be satellites $circling the globe or airplanes traveling between cities.#1#1.35#1#0.535
1401	Jeff the duck is lost. $Where is his pond? $$He walks to a rock. $"This is not my pond." $$He walks to a tree. $"This is not my pond." $$He walks to a tub. $"But I can swim here."#1#1.35#1#0.535
1502	A cat takes a nap. A dog can nap and so $can you. But does a fish nap? $$A fish does not have a bed. It cannot shut $its eyes. $$When a fish takes a nap, it keeps its eyes $open. $$A fish swims when it sleeps! $$Some fish hide when they sleep. After a $fish naps, it looks for food.#1#1.35#1#0.535
1505	Rocky barks at trucks. $$Every day Rocky barks at the mail truck. Here $comes the garbage truck, and Rocky barks. When $Rocky hears a fire truck, he barks. $$Why does he bark so much? $$When he barks, the trucks go away. $Woof! Woof! Woof! $$It works! The trucks go away. Good job, Rocky! $Now he can rest.#1#1.35#1#0.535
1603	Sounds are all around us. Sounds can be loud. $Sounds can be soft. Our ears catch the sounds. $$In the city we can hear the loud sound of trucks. $In the city we can hear the soft sound of bikes. $$In the park we can hear the loud sound of dogs $barking. In the park we can hear the soft sound of $birds singing. We can also hear the ice cream $truck!#1#1.35#1#0.535
1703	Summer is here! Pat and Danny want to walk to $the beach. $$"Don't forget to pack a snack!" calls Mom. Danny $packs some snacks. $$"Don't forget to pack your hats!" Pat packs the hats. $$"Don't forget to pack your umbrella!" "An umbrella? $But it is sunny," says Danny. $$Mom opens the door. "Oh, no!" says Pat. "It is $raining! Let's walk in the rain with our umbrellas!"#1#1.35#1#0.535
1804	I pushed the clay. I looked around the classroom. $Soon it would be my time to share. $$I turned back to my clay and began to push $again. With a small ball of clay, I made a head. $A bigger ball turned into a body. I rolled some $clay on the desk to make legs. $$Then I put my bug together and I was ready to $show the class.#1#1.35#1#0.535
1807	The tide goes out. Little pools of water are left $behind. These are called tide pools. We can see $what it's like under the sea. $$In the pools, you can find plants and small animals. $Some animals swim. Others hide under rocks and $plants. There is a lot of life in the pool. $$When the tide comes back in, the sea covers the $pools, and some of the animals can swim away.#1#1.35#1#0.535
1903	A rooster was out in the yard. He wanted some corn $to eat. $$On the ground, he saw something yellow and bright. $It was hard and round. The rooster ran to get it. He $did not want to share it. $$He pecked at it. It wasn't corn. It was a small piece $of gold! $$"I wish it were corn," said the rooster, "so I could $eat it. This yellow rock is not as tasty as corn."#1#1.35#1#0.535
2001	It is a windy day. Jeff wants to fly his new kite. It $is red and yellow and has a long tail. $$His father gave him the kite for his birthday. He $goes out to the field. He runs fast and lets go of $the kite. It starts to fly. $$He lets out more string and the kite flies very high. $Jeff stops running and watches the kite dance high $in the sky.#1#1.35#1#0.535
2101	Jill and Sam stood in the snow. They watched the $snowflakes falling. $$First they caught snowflakes in their mouths. Then $Jill looked at the snowflakes on her sleeve. She $wondered if the snowflakes were all the same. $$Sam ran inside and came back with a magnifying $glass. When they looked through it, they saw that the $snowflakes had six points. The snowflakes looked $like tiny sparkling stars, each one different from the $next.#1#1.35#1#0.535
2102	Have you seen a mound of dirt in the middle of a $lawn? It may be made by a small furry animal $called a mole. $$Moles are about six inches long. They have tiny $eyes because they don't have to see well under $the ground. $$They have a long pointed nose and strong legs. $They use their sharp claws to dig tunnels under the $ground. They are among the best diggers in the $animal world.#1#1.35#1#0.535
2201	How do plants find homes? $$I saw a flower growing in a sidewalk. I wondered how the plant $got there. $$Seeds travel in different ways. Some seeds just drop to the $ground. The wind or birds carry seeds to new places nearby $or far away. $$Water can take seeds on a journey. Some animals hide seeds $in the ground. Seeds can stick to an animal's fur or to a $person's socks. $$When the seeds fall on the ground, they wait for sun and $water to grow.#1#1.35#1#0.535
2202	Room Six is learning to grow plants. Each student $has a plant and a pot. $$The kids will learn to take care of the houseplants $as they grow. Everyday they will write in their $journals as they learn about the needs of their plants. $$At the end of the school year, they will take their $plants home. But for now, the classroom is much $greener with so many different plants around the $room.#1#1.35#1#0.535
2203	Brian loves summer camp. He goes every summer. $$The camp leaders are very helpful and have lots of fun ideas. $This year, they went for an overnight hike to a lake. $$On the way, they saw two red foxes playing in a field. Everyone $froze. Brian took pictures of the foxes. He was glad he brought $his camera with him. $$When they reached the lake, they set up camp. The night sky $was crystal clear, so Brian watched the stars for a long time $until he fell asleep.#1#1.35#1#0.535
2302	Amy and Brad went biking. They stopped at a pond. $$They looked into the water and saw what looked like $a pile of jelly. It was covered with black dots. $$Amy took a leaf to collect some of the strange $jelly. When they brought it home, their mother $explained that the jelly was just frog eggs. $$The kids left the leaf in some water for a few days. $The black spots grew until they turned into tadpoles, $swimming around in the water.#1#1.35#1#0.535
2401	Today is moving day. Peter's family is moving to a new $house because they need more room. His grandparents $are coming to live with them. $$Peter is excited about moving because the new house is $close to the school. He can walk to school now instead $of riding the bus. $$There is a work shed in the back where he and Grandpa $can work together on wood projects. Peter hopes they can $build a tree house in the large oak tree.#1#1.35#1#0.535
2402	Iceland is a cold place. But parts of it are boiling hot. $$Long ago, the Vikings found hot water and steam from $deep inside the earth. They used this hot water to cook $and wash up. $$Later, Iceland started heating homes with heat from the $earth. Hot water and steam are pumped through the city $to heat buildings. Plants and vegetables are grown year $round in heated greenhouses. Today Iceland uses this clean $energy from deep in the earth to heat houses, streets, $and even football fields.#1#1.35#1#0.535
2403	It hadn't rained lately. Alex went out to water the plants. $In the garden, he saw white flakes floating around the plants. $Could they be snowflakes? $$Not in the summer they couldn't. They reminded him of $flower petals, but they were actually little white butterflies. $$They flew around the garden, landing gently on leaves. $Instead of eating the plants, they left tiny green eggs on $the leaves. That way, when the eggs hatched, the baby $caterpillars would have food.#1#1.35#1#0.535
2503	A jellyfish is a very strange creature. It is a sea animal $that lives in our oceans. $$Unlike fish, jellyfish have no brain, heart, or bones. They $drift with the ocean because they have no way to steer. $$Some jellyfish are the size of your thumbnail, and some $can grow as long as fifty feet. They catch food in their $tentacles as they slowly float along. They are beautiful to $watch, but their painful sting makes them an unpleasant $swimming hazard.#1#1.35#1#0.535
2504	Sharks are curious fish. They want to know what's $in the water with them. $$Sharks learn by smelling and tasting. They bite things $to learn what they are. If something tastes bad, a $shark doesn't want it. $$Sharks think people taste very bad, so they $generally don't want to eat people. There are many $scary movies about sharks that hunt for people, but $sharks are usually harmless to people because $people don't taste very good.#1#1.35#1#0.535
2601	Animals don't sense the world like we do. Many animals have long $stiff hairs, called whiskers, on their faces. While they can be very $cute, they also serve an important purpose. $$Whiskers are used to feel an animal's surroundings. A cat will use $them to see if it can fit its head through a small space. Have you $ever noticed smaller whiskers over your pet's eyes or on its legs? $Whiskers aren't limited to being just around the muzzle. $$Whiskers on the back of a cat's paws can help it feel its prey when $it pounces, making it a better hunter. More whiskers in more places $mean your pet can sense its environment in even more detail.#1#1.35#1#0.535
2701	Lily's grandparents are quite old. At family events, the old folks $just sit around and talk. Lily's not very interested in listening to $their old stories. $$Now her class is learning about how life was different in the old $days. She needs to interview a relative and find out one thing $that they needed daily but that was hard to get. When she asks $her grandfather, he says he doesn't want to discuss the old $days. But her grandmother has lots of information to share. $$When she was young, they had no running water on their farm. $Her job was to fetch water from the well or stream several $times a day, even in the freezing winter.#1#1.35#1#0.535
2801	New Year's is an exciting event. How do you celebrate? In $America, you might watch the midnight ball drop on TV. $When the ball drops in New York City, people sing and $fireworks fill the night sky. $$In Brazil, you might celebrate with a tasty bowl of lentil $soup. Lentils symbolize good fortune. In Russia, you might $look forward to Father Frost's yearly visit. He brings presents $for the children. $$No matter the tradition, New Year's is a hopeful time, $bringing a new beginning to a new year.#1#1.35#1#0.535
2803	Birds and bats can fly. But they aren't the only animals that can $soar through the air. Flying squirrels can glide between tree $branches. $$These squirrels have a membrane, a thin piece of skin, between $their front and back legs that catches the air when they jump. $Flying squirrels don't actually have powered flight, like a bird or $a bat. However, they can coast briefly on the wind before $landing safely in a tree. $$Taking a cue from these gliding squirrels, some human skydivers $wear special suits modeled after the flying squirrel. They use $these suits to guide their flight as they soar through the air. $Among the flying animals of the world, we should include flying $squirrels and some humans!#1#1.35#1#0.535
2902	Chocolate flavors many of our treats. From candy to beverages, $it's hard to think of a time when we didn't have chocolate. $$Cocoa beans were first used by the Mayans around four $thousand years ago. Much like today, cocoa was used for drinks, $but the drinks weren't prepared to be as sweet as we make $them now. Ancient cocoa products were bitter, sometimes $seasoned with chili or vanilla. They were used either as $medicine or for religious reasons. $$When the Spanish tasted the drinks mixed with ground cocoa $beans and water, they called it "chocolate". For a time, cocoa $beans were adopted as a form of money. Could you imagine $paying for your groceries in chocolate?#1#1.35#1#0.535
2904	Andy held his breath. Standing very still, he carefully pushed the $button. As his finger moved, he heard a faint click. Looking $directly at the camera display, he wondered if he had captured it. $$There on the screen was a mass of yellow petals. Andy was $looking for something specific. He enlarged the image, stared for $a moment, and smiled. $$In the lower left corner, blending in with blossoms, a swallowtail $butterfly rested on a petal. He was able to accomplish his goal $of taking a picture of a butterfly at rest. Andy was prepared for $the next photography challenge.#1#1.35#1#0.535
3105	Alex's older sister is in Peru. Last month she moved to a small $village as part of a summer study program with her high school. $Far from the conveniences of her own house, Sylvia lives with a $host family in their small home. $$In the mornings, she is a teacher's helper in a rural school. Sylvia $works with children in arithmetic and reading, without technology. The $village has no electricity and no cellphone reception! After school, $she helps out on the family's small farm, and gets cooking lessons. $$Once a week, Sylvia takes a bus to the nearby town to meet with $others in her program. For the first time all week, she gets an hour $on her computer. She writes to Alex about her experiences. In $addition to improving her Spanish language and cooking skills, she $is learning to get by on limited screen time.#1#1.35#1#0.535
3106	A ship is sailing across the sea. The water starts to get rough, $and the ship begins to sway. Without warning, the skies grow $darker as enormous black clouds move in, and the wind begins $to gust. $$The ship is heading straight into the storm. A turbulent night $awaits them, and the crew prepares, scrambling to secure $equipment and stow the gear below the deck. As the rain begins $to pelt the decks, angry waves crash hard against the sides of $the ship. The storm worsens, growing stronger and fiercer as the $evening goes on. $$In the morning, the crew is relieved when the light of the sun $breaks through the clouds and onto the calm sea.#1#1.35#1#0.535
